# PokéFactory Legends

A comprehensive Minecraft server ecosystem that integrates Cobblemon gameplay with advanced analytics and database tracking. This meta-repository links three interconnected components that work together to provide enhanced Pokemon gameplay experiences.

## 🎮 Architecture Overview

```
Players ↔ Minecraft Server (Mod) ↔ Go API ↔ PostgreSQL Database ↔ Web Analytics
```

**Zero-Attack-Surface Design**: Private operations stay localhost-only while public analytics run on separate infrastructure - eliminates security vs accessibility trade-offs.

## 🔧 Technical Problems I Had to Solve
*I approached these challenges using systematic problem-solving from previous work experience*

### **Security Challenge: Public Access vs Data Protection**
**The Situation**: I needed public analytics while keeping all player data completely secure

**My Approach**: **Physical Separation Architecture**
Like a bank with separate buildings for public services and private vaults, I built two completely isolated systems:
- **Port 8080 (Secure Vault)**: Database operations through localhost-only connections - physically impossible to access externally
- **Port 8081 (Public Lobby)**: Read-only analytics with zero database write permissions - visitors can see displays but can't access records
- **Network Isolation**: Used separate network ports so compromising one system cannot affect the other
- **Layered Authentication**: JWT tokens → Admin UUIDs → Parameterized queries create multiple independent security barriers

*Business Impact: Solves the "public transparency vs data privacy" dilemma - enables customer engagement without security risk*

### **Performance Challenge: Real-Time Load Management**
**The Situation**: Simultaneous Pokemon captures from multiple players would overwhelm the database

**My Approach**: **Predictive Buffering System**
Like managing peak hours at any service business - you need systems that smooth out demand spikes:
- **Smart Caching**: Local server storage provides instant player responses while database processes updates in optimal batches
- **Intelligent Batching**: 30-second intervals timed to natural gameplay patterns - prevents database overload while maintaining data freshness
- **Deduplication Logic**: Eliminates redundant API calls at the source before they consume system resources
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Game performance stays smooth (sub-16ms) while background systems handle data persistence

*Business Impact: Maintains instant user experience under heavy load - prevents customer loss during peak usage*

### **Reliability Challenge: Zero-Tolerance Data Loss**
**The Situation**: Minecraft servers crash unpredictably, but player progress must never be lost

**My Approach**: **Fault-Tolerant Recovery Framework**
Like critical infrastructure that must work during emergencies - multiple backup systems with automatic failover:
- **Continuous Backup**: Every data change saves to multiple locations instantly - no single point of failure
- **Proactive Monitoring**: System health checks detect problems before they cause data loss - like preventive maintenance
- **Emergency Protocols**: Admin recovery tools work even when primary systems fail - manual overrides for crisis situations
- **Atomic Operations**: Database writes either complete fully or leave no trace - prevents data corruption during crashes

*Business Impact: Zero data loss protects customer trust and business reputation - eliminates costly recovery scenarios*

### **Development Challenge: Production-Safe Testing**
**The Situation**: Needed comprehensive testing without any risk to live player data

**My Approach**: **Environment-Aware Security Framework**
Like having a separate workshop for experimental work - identical capabilities with zero risk to production:
- **Automatic Detection**: System recognizes development vs production environments and applies appropriate security automatically
- **Isolated Simulation**: Test environment mirrors production behavior while maintaining complete separation
- **Input Sanitization**: System only accepts data from verified game events, eliminating user input attack vectors
- **Zero-Configuration Security**: No manual setup required - security adapts automatically to prevent human error

*Business Impact: Accelerates development without compromising security - reduces time-to-market while eliminating deployment risks*
